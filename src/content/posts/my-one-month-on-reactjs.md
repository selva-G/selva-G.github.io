Its ben a month since I dove into react and it has been an incredible journey, where I just concentrated in learning more things.

- I was able to get my head around webpack, react, react-router, redux, thunks
- Started with a minor contribution to [react/react-tabs](https://github.com/reactjs/react-tabs/pull/108)
- Rolled out a react package, [react-async-button](https://github.com/selvagsz/react-async-button)
- Completed my POC & was able to convince my team to migrate our app from angularjs(1.12.x) >> react
- Began to dive into the react source code (https://gist.github.com/selvagsz/4889bfd6d3716bc56543d30597d9728a)
